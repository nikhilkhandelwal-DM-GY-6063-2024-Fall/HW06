# HW06 Data Visualization: Motor Vehicle Collisions in NYC

## Dataset
**Dataset Name**: NYC Motor Vehicle Collisions  
**Source**: Provided in the course (uploaded dataset `crashes.csv`)

## Reason for Choosing This Dataset
This dataset provides insights into motor vehicle collisions across NYC’s boroughs, highlighting patterns in crash severity and locations. This visualization can help identify high-risk areas and the relative danger levels in each borough.

## Fields Used
- **BOROUGH**: Used to categorize and color-code each crash point.
- **PERSONS_INJURED** and **PERSONS_KILLED**: Combined to represent the severity of each crash.

## Data Points
The dataset includes over 1000 data points, visualized based on their location and severity.

## Visualization Description
This interactive map of NYC displays motor vehicle collisions by borough:
- **Color Coding**: Each borough is uniquely color-coded, with a legend in the bottom right corner.
- **Circle Size**: Larger circles represent more severe crashes (in terms of injuries and fatalities).
- **Hover Feature**: Hovering over a circle shows crash details (`Borough`, `Injuries`, `Fatalities`, and `Severity`). A message in the top left corner reminds users of this feature.
  
This visualization aligns with the principles of W. E. B. Du Bois and Edward Tufte, focusing on clarity, minimalism, and interactivity.

## Instructions
- **GitHub Setup**: Save the code in a GitHub repository called `HW06`. Enable GitHub Pages in the repository settings.
- **Submission**: Submit the GitHub link to Brightspace.

## References
The visualization approach is inspired by Edward Tufte’s and W. E. B. Du Bois’s data storytelling principles, prioritizing clear, impactful, and minimalistic design.
